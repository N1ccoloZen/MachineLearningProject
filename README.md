This is the project for Machine Learning course. The entire project is done with jupyter notebooks, just run the cells if you want to train from scratch the models, otherwise download the pretrained models from the folder and run the test cells. You can find the CUB_200_2011 dataset on kaggle [here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenewone/cub2002011).
